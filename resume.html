                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p><em>Fidelity Investments | Associate Software Engineer</em> January 2021 - Present</p>
                <p>Working in an agile scrum team in Fidelity Brokerage Technology to assist on a Tier 0 application where I am a part of developing
                  and supporting producer services and cloud-based API solutions in real-time for customers to view their balances for day to day
                  decisions and long-term planning.</p>
                <p><em>Macy's Systems and Technology | Software Engineer</em> February - April 2020</p>
                <p>Worked closely in an agile scrum team on the Unified Price Management project where I assisted with JUnit tests and improved coverage by forty percent 
                  for a project as well as wrote API calls to add data from GCP Spanner using IntelliJ and Spring Boot.
                  I also improved small front-end features to make the application more user-friendly for pricing managers with ReactJS and Visual
                  Studio Code. I added new changesets to columns, inserts, and indexes as well as created new tables for new business requirements with
                  GCP Spanner.</p>
                <p><em>Fidelity Investments | Software Engineering Intern</em> June - August 2019</p>
                <p>Worked closely in an agile scrum team in Asset Management Technology using Jira and Confluence.
                  Focused on strengthening the testing environment to bring it closer to the production environment by mimicking a third-party recipient 
                  acknowledging trade files in the automation testing environments using Java and Spring.
                  Additionally, I worked on the CCPA Excel Inventory by looking at database tables using SQLDeveloper to identify and mark data elements
                  of personal identifiers in Excel.</p>
                <p><em>Rensselaer Center for Open Source | Student Software Developer</em> May - July 2018</p>
                <p>Contributed to Submitty (www.submitty.org), an open-source project, with a focus on displaying images scraped from the
                  Student Information System of student images for staff to use for labs, assignment grading, and/or exams as well as
                  displaying and hosting course material files for both students and the teaching staff to access and use.</p>
